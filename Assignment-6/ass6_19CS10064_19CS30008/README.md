## Target Code Generator for TinyC

To build the program, there is a Makefile which can be run by invoking `make`.

On running `make`, the executable `tinyC` is generated in the root directory.

The test inputs are given inside `./test-inputs`. On running `make test`, outputs are generated in `./test-outputs`. The outputs consist of the Three-Address-Code representation, the symbol tables, the assembly files and the object files. Executable binaries for the test files are generated in `./bin`.
